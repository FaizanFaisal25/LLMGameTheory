# LLMGameTheory

![video](./video.gif)

`LLMGameTheory` is a simulation of the Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It's primary aim is to explore and observe the dynamics of cooperation and competition between several agents. Each agent stores and utilizes information on interaction history to make future strategic decisions. The game also provides opportunities to explore how these agents evolve and adapt their strategies over time based on their interactions.

# Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   You can clone the repo using this command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/LLMGameTheory
   ```
   
2. **Install the requirements**

   Navigate into the downloaded folder and install the Python requirements using pip:

   ```
   cd LLMGameTheory
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Add API keys**

   Create a .env file in the server folder and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` there.

   ```
   cd server
   touch .env
   echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key' >> .env
   echo 'TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key' >> .env
   ```

4. **Install client dependencies**

   In a new terminal window, navigate into the client folder and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

# Usage

1. **Start the server**

   Navigate back into the server folder and start the Python Flask server:

   ```
   cd ../server
   python flask_server.py
   ```

2. **Start the client**

   In another terminal window, navigate into the client folder and start the React application:

   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

   This should start the frontend of the LLMGameTheory simulation.
